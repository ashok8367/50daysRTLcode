# Welcome to My 50DaysOfRTL!
WELCOME TO MY 50DAYSOFRTL

ðŸ‘‹ Hello there! I'm Venna Ashok, and I'm passionate about digital design and RTL coding. This repository is dedicated to my 50DaysOfRTL challenge, where I'll be sharing my progress and projects related to RTL coding using Xilinx Vivado and ModelSim for simulation.
 

About Me

I'm an enthusiastic engineer and a VLSI enthusiast with a strong interest in digital design and hardware description languages (HDLs). As a student, I have gained hands-on experience in RTL coding using Verilog and have worked extensively with Xilinx Vivado.

My passion lies in the world of VLSI design, and I thrive on exploring the possibilities and challenges it offers. I enjoy diving deep into digital design concepts and leveraging HDLs to create efficient and optimized RTL designs.

With a focus on continuous learning, I am dedicated to expanding my knowledge in areas such as FPGA development, synthesis, and verification. I actively seek opportunities to enhance my skills and stay updated with the latest advancements in the field.

This GitHub repository serves as a platform for me to showcase my RTL projects and document my learning journey. I aim to share my experiences, exchange ideas, and collaborate with fellow enthusiasts in the VLSI community.

Join me on this exciting adventure in digital design and RTL coding, as I leverage Xilinx Vivado and my passion for VLSI to create innovative solutions!

Repository Contents
In this repository, you'll find a collection of my basic RTL projects, including:

Multiplexers (Muxes)
Counters (Binary, BCD, Up/Down)
Sequence detectors
Shift registers
Arithmetic logic units (ALUs)
Finite state machines (FSMs)
And more!
Each project includes the RTL code, simulation files, and relevant documentation, allowing you to explore and understand the implementation details.

These projects are great starting points for learning RTL coding concepts and building foundational knowledge in digital design.

Tools and Technologies

I primarily use Xilinx Vivado and ModelSim for RTL simulation. Vivado provides a powerful platform for designing, implementing, and debugging FPGA-based digital systems. ModelSim, on the other hand, offers a comprehensive simulation environment for testing and verifying the functionality of my RTL designs.
